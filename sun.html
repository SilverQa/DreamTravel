<h1>The best places for sun seekers and beach bunnies</h1>

    <h3>1.Ladera, St. Lucia</h3>
    <div class="article">
        What's special: Jaw-dropping views of the island's iconic Pitons, the sea, and sky (with a beach more than 1,000 feet below) from rooms without a fourth wall. Be prepared for a chorus of early morning bird song and nighttime tree frog croaking. Furniture is quirky and rustic, private plunge pools haven't much wiggle-room, but the overall ambience is incredibly romantic and secluded.
